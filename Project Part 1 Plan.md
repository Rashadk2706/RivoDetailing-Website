Project Idea: Car Detailing Website

Why we chose a Car detailing website:

The project we are creating is a simple car detailing website that allows users to book detailing services in an easy and organized way. The goal of this project is to make it simple for customers to schedule car detailing appointments without the hassle of calling or visiting in person. Users will be able to browse available detailing packages, view pricing and service options, and book a time that fits their schedule. This system will help make the booking process faster and more convenient for both the business and its users. 

The website will be designed for anyone who wants to keep their car clean and well maintained. It will include an easy to use layout that is user friendly where users can view different detailing options such as interior cleaning, exterior polishing, waxing, paint correction, packages, etc. Each service option will include details about what's included, how long it takes, and exactly what it provides for the car. Users will be able to select the service they want, as well as add any addons, and the total price. Once they have made their choice, they will be allowed to create their booking and they will also get a confirmation email once the booking has been made and a reminder sent a day in advance for their booking. 

The project will include key pages such as the homepage that introduces the business, a services page that lists all detailing packages, a booking page where users can schedule a service, and a contact page for questions or special requests. The website will later be expanded to include features such as customer reviews, links to social media, and previous work examples. Overall this project aims to create an efficient and professional way for customers to book a car detailing service online.
